\section{Introduction}
Maven was created by a group of software developers 
who were tired of wasting their time 
fiddling around with builds and wanted to get down to brass tacks 
and actually develop software! (See \cite{Massol:2005fy})

\section{Outroduction}

Maven saves you so much time in your software development efforts 
that you will have time to learn a second language, 
relax ten hours a day, and train for that marathon you've always wanted to run!
