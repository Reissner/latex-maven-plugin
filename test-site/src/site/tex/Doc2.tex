\section{Introduction}\label{sec_Introduction}

Maven was created by a group of software developers 
who were tired of wasting their time fiddling around with builds 
and wanted to get down to brass tacks and actually develop software!

\section{Outroduction}
Maven saves you so much time in your software development efforts 
that you will have time to learn a second language, relax ten hours a day, 
and train for that marathon you've always wanted to run! See section \ref{sec_Introduction}
