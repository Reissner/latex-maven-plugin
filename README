latex-maven-plugin

Use the maven-latex-plugin in your Maven2 projects to automatically create 
pdf, rtf and/or html documents from your LaTeX sources. 
The plugin will call the LaTeX, latex2rtf and TeX4Ht scripts 
to do the necessary work. 
Of course these should be installed when using this plugin.

Maven coordinates:

<dependency>
   <groupId>de.akquinet.jbosscc.latex</groupId>
   <artifactId>latex-maven-plugin</artifactId>
   <version>1.3</version> 
</dependency>

Note latex-maven-plugin was formerly maven-latex-plugin. 
The rename is due to new conventions. 
All in all version 1.3 is just an update 
using java 1.6 (formerly 1.3) and junit 4 (formerly 3), 
adding some missing parameters, 
renaming and adding further goals for various output. 
Also, warnings were added. 
Also, makeindex is now supported and also a single preprocessor, 
fig2dev in a rudimentary way. 

A maven plugin is just an interface between maven 
and the application(s) doing all the work. 
In this case, needed are 
- a derivative of latex, as latex, pdflatex or something 
- something like bibtex 
- something like makeindex 
- tex4ht for creation of all but rtf, pdf and dvi 
  including html, odt and doc 
- latex2rtf for creation of rtf 
- odt2doc for creation of doc and docx
