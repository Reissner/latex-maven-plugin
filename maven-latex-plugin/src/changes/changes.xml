       processing in source directories
       which is considered the working directory
       and move of results into target directory.
       Also clean goal and task to restore the source directory.
       This eases development of latex files considerably
       because one can invoke the needed tools directly
       without using this plugin/task.
       Also one can use forward/backward search between editor and viewer.
       But the viewer has to be in the source directory then.
       Nevertheless cleaning up works. 
       </action>
