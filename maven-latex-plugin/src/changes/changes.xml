    <!-- Release plan: 
	 For 1.8: 
	 - further output formats: xml from latexml, epub. 
	   in manual: flow oriented vs page oriented. 
	   Flow oriented: html, ... epub, ... 
	   Page oriented: pdf, latex (dvi), office (odt, xdoc, ...)
	   Take multipubguide.pdf into account.
	 - Further exporters with config to access them 
	   besides latex2ht also latexml, pandoc 
	   Have a look at texnische komoedie, pdf checked in. 
	 - take pylatex into account: can there be a relation.
	 - take pythontex into account: 
	   maybe according support in separate release 
	   The converter is added already, 
	   but there is no ConverterCategory yet. 
	   Take also cleaning into account. 
	 For 1.7: 
	 - support for pythontex 
	 For 1.6:
	 - make capabilities inspired by latexmk: 
	   If latex is invoked with option -recorder it creates a file .fls
	   containing all the files read during its run. 
	   If this software runs latex, after that it looks for an .fls file 
	   and if found stores an .lmk file 
	   containing hashs for the files mentioned in .fls. 
	   These hashs indicate potential changes. 
	   As a first step we may use modification time. 
	   In the next run, before invoking latex, 
	   this software checks whether the .lmk file is present. 
	   If not, latex is invoked. 
	   If it is present, then it is invoked only 
	   if files is modified, including the source. 
	   We need a mechanism to know whether invoked as a maven plugin, 
	   ant task or standalone. 
	   The latter stores command line file reflecting command line options. 
	   Then also the config, e.g. pom.xml, build.xml or command line file 
	   is taken into account to detect changes. 
	   Hm, no. If something changes in pom, that is no indication. 
	   There must be a file, maybe in ~/.lmk, 
	   reflecting the options of the last run. 
	 For 1.5: 
	 - meta info for this software including own version 
	   git interface 
	 - awareness of version of converters, both expected and actual 
	   Add also according testcases 
	 - this software offered also as a standalone application 
	   and as an api to integrate everywhere. 
	 - also for documentation, meta information 
	   like version but also author email and so on are vital. 
	   To that end, either git checkout script is needed 
	   or maybe latex git package. 
	   Note that there may be documentation not created through latex 
	   and so git package may not be a generic solution. 
	 - include docs in jar.
	 - redesign: Target s are creational ones.
	   In mojos we also have creational ones and others.
	   The method AbstractLatexMojo.getTargetSet()
           is appropriate for creational targets only.
	   Maybe rename Target-{}->CreationalTarget,
	   and redesign: CreationalMojo.getTargetSet().
	 - There must be a mojo for phase validate or initialize
	   checking the most important things:
	 - Whether the converters mentioned are registered.
	   This refers to the commands to run and to the excluded converters.
	 - make it into maven central. Adapt manual accordingly. 
	   see https://maven.apache.org/repository/guide-central-repository-upload.html
	 - have a look at https://github.com/apache/maven-clean-plugin/ 
	   and adapt the own plugin: e.g. test harness. 
	 - https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-docck-plugin/
	 - The ant task cannot be created from source using ant alone, 
	   still maven is needed. 
	   One of the major problems is, that the class Settings 
	   depends on maven annotations. 
	 - bugfix: in ant task texPath cannot be used. 
	   The problem seems in Commandexecutor line 250 around: 
	   fig2dev is invoked as /home/ernst/...../fig2dev with complete path 
	   but in ant task only. 
	 - add latexmk to dependencies (because of cleaning)
	   converter is already known. 
	   TBD: add a category and maybe target clearwith latexmk, 
	   maybe also a parameter using latexmk. 
	   Also, files created by latexmk shall be cleared. 
	 - clean goal based on (categories of) coverters.

	 <!-- TBD: allow for more restrictions in versions of converters. 
		An application would be to ensure strict reproducibility 
		which requires certain diff tools but also certain versions of e.g. pdflatex. 
		Another application is that the version released by the author is not the one 
		available to the user. 
		Then (s)he should be able to use another version at own risk. 
		Another application is using pythontex which works together with latexmk only in later versions. 
		This is also a reason why also software not invoked directly could be vresion checked. 
		Other candidates could be vs code or emacs or octave or ocular. 
		To that end, expect a file named .versions.properties in the tex source directory overriding the default. 
		As info add the file versions are actually read from. 
		The rest is as now. -->

	 <!-- "Bug report" on makeindex and xindy with consequences on makeglossaries: 
		If a term is used in the glossary only, e.g. a term x is used in the text, 
		but to explain x you need term u and this is used in the glossary only, 
		e.g. to explain x, then the call sequence 
			pdflatex, makeglossaries, pdflatex 
		wont put y into the glossary. 
		You have to use the sequence 
			pdflatex, makeglossaries, pdflatex, makeglossaries, pdflatex 
		in contrast would do. 
		The task is to find out whether an additional `makeglossaries, pdflatex` 
		is necessary and to it if needed only. 
		Note that makeglossaries is based on makeindex or xindy. 
		One has to check whether an according problem occurs with the index also. 
		There is an email from Nicola Talbot, the author of makeglossaries 
		which offers more detail information. 
	 -->
	 <!-- TBD: in particular in conjunction with pythontex, 
		latex requires a lot of memory and runs out of memory quickly. 
		So far we use pdflatex, because we are conservative. This is also the default. 
		In the long run I would like to switch to lualatex. 
		Note that certain packages are needed no longer or are even to be abandoned. 
		As a frist step I would like to specify lualatex in all internal projects 
		including phd thesis. 
		Then, if all turns out to be still working change the default value in the lnext release.

	<!-- document development: I think, that newly created files are removed after the run is a good thing: 
		That way, if all is clean at the beginning, at the end it is clean also without further cleaning up. 
		Also during document development intermediate files remain where they are. 
		
		On the other hand, this behavior is not so easily understood. 
		It looks as some files persist while others disappear quite randomly. 
		Thus in the manual in section on document development, 
		we need the advise to command `mvn latex:grp` if the graphics shall be needed for further development. 
		This is the sole target without cleanup. 
		This shall be done in particular when using vscode/latexworkshop 
		because otherwise, the build process fails. 
		Another option is to set in the settings <cleanUp>false</cleanUp>. 
		Check whether cleanup is skipped if an error occurs. 
		This would be fine, because it integrates with document development. 

		Maybe more thoughts on how to work in document development. 
		Use case: sth went wrong with the latex plugin. 
		Then it shall be seemless to switch to document development, 
		all created files still present. 
		Use case: changing some file triggers automatic rebuild of document development tool. 
		This is assumed to be latexmk, maybe triggered by vscode/latexworkshop. 
		Advised to use .latexmkrc file with settings consistent with those for this latex plugin. 
		
		
		. I suspect, that mvn latex:pdf really moves the pdf file to the target, 
		rather than copying it. 
		Well, all other created files, the auxiliary ones, 
		are not cleared also. 
		This makes sense for document development. 
		But then also copying the pdf instead of moving it would be more consistent. 
	-->
	<!-- TBD: seemingly, created image files are removed after successful creation, 
		whereas created auxiliary files created by latex remain in the working directory. 
		This is highly inconsistent. 
		For sake of document development, all files shall remain unchanged. 
	-->
	<!-- TBD: add support for \include: 
		Include adds aux files which this plugin does not eliminate through mvn latex:clr. 
	-->
	<!-- TBD: also  fdb_latexmk is deleted and this plugin shall do this also. -->
	<!-- TBD: clarify whether package hyperref shall be loaded for pdf output only: 
		with dvi with option [dvipdfmx]. 
		This must be done in all documents. 
	--> 
	<!-- TBD: eliminate letter size using package geometry (robustindex) -->

<!-- gap: in pythontex package dont use \setpythontexoutputdir 
	because this is not forseen in pattern patternCreatedFromLatexMain 
also modification of working directory with \setpythontexworkingdir is not supported. 
-->

<!-- with pythontexW and depythontexW, we need unregistered converters, 
	and this is true for other converters also. 
	So Exception TSS06 in Settings.java is not appropriate. 
	We need a way to register a converter for a ConverterCategory. 
	I think, we shall copy technique of javaoctave. -->

	<!-- add a way to include/exclude main files. 
		This would also ease development of this software in particular, deactivating the whole manual -->

	<!-- unlike othe converters, pythontex does not always update its result files. 
		Normally, there is a check that the result files changed. 
		It must be possible to pypass that. 
		A hack is to check the plg file. 
		Better would be some switch on activation of update check. 
		Best: tied to option -{}-rerun=always or -{}runall=true. 
		The problem is, that package options override command line options, 
		which is a bad idea. 
		To overcome, just eliminate one result file. 
		This forces pythontex to update all: a not documented feature shihc may hardlcy change. 
	-->
	<!-- TBD: full check of output: 
		This requires reading the pytxcode file to find out the names of the stdout files. -->
	<!-- 	Maybe one can eliminate package options rerun and runall. from pytxcode file. 
		That way, rerun can be controlled via command line option 
		and thus by this software invoking pythontex. -->
	<!-- TBD: use std/err output to detect rerun information, not log files: 
		this is much faster. -->

	<!-- TBD: rerunfilecheck and out files created by hyperref -->
	<!-- TBD: fix [WARNING] WPP03: Skipped processing of files with suffixes [, .latexmkrc, .log]. -->
	<!-- TBD: consider https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/7770/file-extensions-related-to-latex-etc -->
	<!-- TBD: rework on glossaries: use `glossaries-extra` in conjunction with `bib2gls`. 
		This is because 
		- rerunfilecheck does not work with the traditional workflow. 
		- it is not easy to treat the case of cross references of glossary entries explaining one with the other term 
		- it is difficult to extend to more than one glossary 
		- ABOVE ALL: explanations and that like shall be in a separate file accessible from more than one tex file. 
		  This is like bibliographies. 
			Thus it is a good idea to have a similar workflow: lualatex, bib2gls transforming aux and bib to glotex
			one has just to replace loading `glossaries` by `glossaries-extra` with package option `record`. 

			have a look at the src/site/doc/glossary folder containing 
			- glossaries-extra and bib2gls: An Introductory Guide 
			  in particular Section 7
			- other literature is in the same folder 
			Please extend the bibliography 

			All problems mentioned above are solved: 
			- since with option `record` info is written in aux file, `rerunfilecheck` can detect changes 
			- bib2gls includes all entries referenced in the tex-file and all depending on it: 
			  so also those required for explanations, and for explanations of explanations and so on. 
			- \GlsXtrLoadResources allows to load a bib-file with entries. 
			  It is possible to load more than one resource, consult the above reference, sections 1.2 and 1.3. 
				Even with more than one index, bib2glo is invoked the same way. 

			The according section in Chapter 5 must be extended: a subsection on the new way, 
			and a section on the old way with criticism. 
			A switch legacyGlossaries which is false by default.

       processing in source directories
       which is considered the working directory
       and move of results into target directory.
       Also clean goal and task to restore the source directory.
       This eases development of latex files considerably
       because one can invoke the needed tools directly
       without using this plugin/task.
       Also one can use forward/backward search between editor and viewer.
       But the viewer has to be in the source directory then.
       Nevertheless cleaning up works.
