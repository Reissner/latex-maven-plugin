# Bibtex and Co

Bibtex is used without a package in general but it can also be used by the `bibtex` package 
as a backend. 
For sake of uniformity we moved all tools concerned with bibliography at the same place 
and devote bibtex and related a separate [folder](./../../PackagesWithTools/Bibliography/BibtexAndCo). 
This file is kept as a reference from the place the user may expect documentation 
to the place where it really is.
