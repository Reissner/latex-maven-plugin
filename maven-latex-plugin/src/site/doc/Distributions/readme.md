# Tex Distributions 

Among the most important [distributions](https://tug.org/interest.html#free), 
two seem to be of outstanding importance: 

- TeX Live, which works on unixoid operating systems and on windows, and 
- MiKTeX which works on windows only but seems widely used on that operating system. 
  
For TeX Live, there is documentation [online](https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc.html) 
and this is also the site from which the [pdf in this folder](#texlive-en.pdf) is downloaded. 

For MiKTeX the documentation is available [online](https://docs.miktex.org/manual/) only.
