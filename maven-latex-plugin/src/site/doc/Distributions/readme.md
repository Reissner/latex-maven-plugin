# Tex Distributions 

Up to now two distributions are known, texlive, which works on unixoid operating systems 
and on windows, and miktex which works on windows only. 
For texlive, there is documentation [online](https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc.html) 
and this is also the site from which the [pdf in this folder](#texlive-en.pdf) is downloaded. 

For miktex the documentation is available [online](https://docs.miktex.org/manual/) only.
