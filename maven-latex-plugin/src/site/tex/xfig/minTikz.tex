This document just illustrates the use of document class \texttt{minimal} 
applied to illustrate the export functionality of the \texttt{xfig} tool 
creating \texttt{tikz} pictures. 
The document class \texttt{minimal} is special in that no PDF properties are created, 
because it serves as a wrapper for details like pictures in the course of document development. 

This document shows, that the \texttt{xfig} format 
can be translated without loss into the \texttt{tikz} format.
