\chapter{Processing of \LaTeX{} Main Files}\label{chap:latexMainConversions}

Given graphics in formats includable in TEX files, 
which may require preprocessing described in 
Chapter~\ref{chap:GraphConversions}, 
this section describes the conversions of latex main files 
into target files in detail. 
The most important target file format is \gls{pdf}. 
Conversion into this format is described in Section~\ref{sec:tex2pdf}. 
Note that \gls{pdf} also occurs as source format 
for included pictures and as intermediate files. 
Specific for \LaTeX{} is the \gls{dvi} format, 
which is supported mainly for historical reasons. 
% FIXME\@: nowhere described. 

Almost independent of the format created, 
Inclusion of bibliographies, indices and glossaries 
requires additional conversions 
done by several auxiliary programs. 
Bibliographies are described in Section~\ref{sec:bibtex}, 
indices in Section~\ref{sec:indices} 
and glossaries in Section~\ref{sec:glossaries}. 
Only at the first sight different 
but behind the scenes quite analogous 
is inclusion of results of code evaluations, 
code in python and other languages described in Section~\ref{sec:pythontex}. 
Here, an auxiliary program essentially invokes the language interpreter. 

Sections~\ref{sec:rerunMakeIndexGlossaries} 
and~\ref{sec:rerunLatex} 
are special in that they describe rerunning auxiliary programs 
and the \LaTeX-to-pdf converter, 
which may be necessary even if certain lists are present 
like table of contents list of figures or list of tables. 

Section~\ref{sec:chkReprod} is special in that it is not related with conversion 
but with checking reproducibility. 

Besides the output formats traditional for \LaTeX, 
\gls{pdf} and \gls{dvi} describing e.g.~books, 
Section~\ref{sec:tex2html} describes creation of 
\gls{html}, Section~\ref{sec:tex2odt} the creation of \gls{odt} and 
Section~\ref{sec:tex2doc} creation of MS Word formats like \gls{docx}. 
Finally, also pure text can be generated 
as described in Section~\ref{sec:tex2txt}.

\section{Transforming \LaTeX{} files into PDF files}\label{sec:tex2pdf}

The next step is to create a PDF file from the TEX files. 
\LaTeX{} distinguishes master TEX files from TEX files intended to be inputted
from elsewhere. 
Not taking comments and that like into account, 
master TEX files roughly have the form 
%
%\lstset{language=tex, basicstyle=\small}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=tex, basicstyle=\small]
\RequirePackage[l2tabu, orthodox]{nag} % optional 
\documentclass{...}

\begin{document}
...
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}

The core of conversion of a TEX file into a PDF file 
is running a \LaTeX{}-to-pdf converter \texttt{latex2pdf} 
to a master TEX file \texttt{xxx.tex}.
The \LaTeX-to-pdf converter \texttt{latex2pdf} 
is configurable via the parameter \texttt{latex2pdfCommand}. 
Possible values are \lualatex{}, \xelatex{} and \pdflatex, 
where the first is the default for which this software is also tested. 
It is also possible to pass parameters to the \LaTeX{}-to-pdf converter. 
Besides conversion into \gls{pdf} format, 
all converters offer conversion to the older \gls{dvi} format 
via option \texttt{-{}-output-format} as \lualatex{} and \pdflatex, 
or the alternative \gls{xdv} generalizing \gls{dvi} 
as \xelatex{} does with the option \texttt{-{}-no-pdf}. 

In fact, the converter \texttt{latex2pdf} 
does much more than converting TEX files to PDF files. 
Figure~\ref{fig:tex2pdf} shows for \texttt{latex2pdf} set e.g.~to \lualatex{}, 
that besides the PDF file also a LOG file and an AUX file is created. 
The LOG file contains logging information on the run of the conversion 
and the aux-file transports information from one run to the next, 
writing in one run and reading in the next run. 
Thus, conversion goes without it, but it is read if present. 
This is why it is depicted at input side in dashed lines. 

Optionally, an FLS file is created containing paths to the files 
the converted \LaTeX{} file depends on 
and a file with ending \texttt{synctex.gz} 
with information for mapping locations at the created PDF file 
to the according input files. 
This is to support backward search, meaning click on a place in the PDF viewer 
opens an editor in the source file. 

What is in fact in the aux-file depends on the package. 
Among other information, 
also citations and the location of the bibliography file with ending bib 
are present. 
This cannot be used directly in the next \texttt{latex2pdf} run 
to create the bibliography, 
because the entries referenced in the document must be extracted from the bib-file 
and sorted. 
This is done by invoking \texttt{bibtex} between two \texttt{latex2pdf} runs. 
Based on the aux-file, \texttt{bibtex} creates a bbl-file 
containing the bibliography, which is read in the next \texttt{latex2pdf} run. 
For details see Section~\ref{sec:bibtex}. 

Alternatively to \texttt{bibtex} a bibliography can be created 
with the package \pkg{biblatex} in conjunction with the auxiliary program \texttt{biber}. 
Running a \LaTeX-to-pdf converter with package \pkg{biblatex} loaded 
creates a \gls{bcf}-file read by \texttt{biber}. 
This software does not support that option. 
Nevertheless, for sake of completeness we added this data path to Figure~\ref{fig:tex2pdf}. 

If an index is demanded, 
in addition \texttt{latex2pdf} creates a \gls{idx}-file. 
As the citations, it cannot be used directly to create an index in
the next \texttt{latex2pdf} run, 
because the index entries must be collected and sorted before. 
This is done by invoking \texttt{makeindex} 
between the two \texttt{latex2pdf} runs. 
Based on the \gls{idx}-file, \texttt{makeindex} creates a \gls{ind}-file 
containing the index, which is read in the next \texttt{latex2pdf} run. 
For details see Section~\ref{sec:indices}. 

If more than one index is demanded, 
we suggest using \texttt{splitindex} instead of \texttt{makeindex} 
which creates one \gls{ind}-file per index. 

If a glossary is demanded, this can be read off the \gls{aux}-file 
and a \gls{glo}-file containing the index entries 
is created and a file with style information. 
Depending on the configuration, 
this may be a \gls{ist}-file or a \gls{xdy}-file. 
As for the index the \gls{idx}-file, 
the \gls{glo}-file cannot be used directly to create a glossary in
the next \texttt{latex2pdf} run, 
because the glossary entries must be collected and sorted before. 
This is done by invoking \texttt{makeglossaries} 
between the two \texttt{latex2pdf} runs. 
Based on the \gls{glo}-file, \texttt{makeglossaries} creates a \gls{gls}-file 
containing the glossary, which is read in the next \texttt{latex2pdf} run. 
For details see Section~\ref{sec:glossaries}. 

The package \pkg{pythontex} allows including python code or related 
in the \gls{tex}-file and to evaluate it. 
The first \texttt{latex2pdf} run creates a \gls{pytxcode}-file 
which contains essentially the code parts of the \LaTeX-file. 
Invoking \texttt{pythontex} creates by default 
a folder \texttt{pythontex-files-xxx} 
with material where code is already evaluated. 
In the next \texttt{latex2pdf} run, this material is included in the document. 
The \pkg{pythontex} comes with a second command line utility, 
\texttt{depythontex}, eliminating all python code from the original tex-file. 
Optionally, \texttt{latex2pdf} also creates a \gls{depytx}-file 
with all information to replace python code in the original tex-file 
with evaluated material from \texttt{pythontex-files-xxx}. 
Replacement is done by \texttt{depythontex} 
which by default, sends the result to stdout, 
but there is an option to write into another \LaTeX-file. 
Converting this new \LaTeX-file 
yields the same result as converting the original one. 
Depythonization is a feature needed e.g.~for papers 
when the publisher does not accept included code. 
For details see Section~\ref{sec:pythontex}. 

In addition, if
a table of contents, a list of figures, a list of tables 
or a list of listings is required, 
also a toc-file, a lof-file, a lot-file and a lol-file is created,
respectively, 
collecting the according information. 
Also, if hyper-references are built, an \gls{out}-file 
containing bookmarks is created. 
If such a file is present, it is read in and is used
to create a table of contents, a list of figures, of tables and of listings 
or bookmarks in the second run of \texttt{latex2pdf}. 

To summarize, 
if a table of contents, a list of figures, a list of tables, a list of listings or 
a bibliography, an index or a glossary is present, 
or if code must be replaced by their evaluation, 
a second \LaTeX{} run is required to make that material appear in the pdf-output. 

If a table of contents and at the same time 
a bibliography, an index or a glossary is present, 
even two further \LaTeX{} runs are required: 
After the first one, the bibliography, the index or the glossary 
occurs in the PDF file but not yet in the table of contents. 
This happens after the second additional \LaTeX{} run. 
As described in Sections~\ref{sec:rerunMakeIndexGlossaries} and~\ref{sec:rerunLatex}, 
further runs of \texttt{makeindex}, resp,~\texttt{splitindex}, 
\texttt{makeglossaries} 
and of the \LaTeX-processor \texttt{latex2pdf} may be necessary.

\end{figure}

\section{Bibliographies}\label{sec:bibtex}

In case the \LaTeX{}-to-pdf converter writes bibliographic information, 
into its aux-file, a bibliography must be generated. 
For each occurrence of a \cmd{cite}-command in the TEX file, 
\texttt{latex2pdf} writes an according entry \cmd{citation} into the aux-file. 
Moreover, a \cmd{bibliography}-command in the TEX file 
writes a link to the bib-file containing the bibliography data 
into the aux-file as \cmd{bibdata}. 
Optionally, a \cmd{bibliographystyle}-command in the TEX file 
writes a link to the bibliography style file 
into the aux-file as \cmd{bibstyle}. 

To create a bibliography, 
a \texttt{bibtexCommand} must be run after the \LaTeX{} run. 
The default command is the traditional \texttt{bibtex}, 
but there are more modern alternatives 
like \texttt{bibtexu} and \texttt{bibtex8} supporting utf8 encoding 
and others. 

% mention Biber and biblatex and also mlbibtex 

Essentially, \texttt{bibtex} extracts the citations in the aux-file, 
unifies them, i.e.~a citation is listed once even if it is used more than once, 
retrieves the according entries from the bib-file, sorts these, 
performs formatting and writes all into a bbl-file 
which can be included in the next run of \texttt{latex2pdf}. 

Note that after a \texttt{bibtex}-run, 
two \LaTeX{} runs are required: 
The first one just puts the bibliography found in the bbl-file 
into the PDF file and the labels of the citations into the aux-file 
as \cmd{bibcite}-commands. 
The second run places the labels of the citations found in the aux-file 
at the citations given by \cmd{cite}. 
The package \pkg{tocbibind} described in~\cite{TocBibIndP}, 
then writes the headline of the bibliography into the table of contents.\index{table of contents}
The package \pkg{rerunfilecheck} described in~\cite{RerunFChkP}, 
ensures that \texttt{latex2pdf} is rerun if needed, 
provided loaded with option \texttt{aux}. 


This software presupposes, that \texttt{bibtex} reads the aux-file 
and creates a bbl-file and also an blg-file with logging output 
as illustrated by Figure~\ref{fig:aux2bbl}. 
From the blg-file this software may determine 
whether \texttt{bibtex} emitted an error or warnings.

\import{}{F5_02aux2bbl.ptx}
}
\caption{\label{fig:aux2bbl}
Conversion of an aux-file into a bbl-file using a bibliography}
\end{figure}

Vital information on \texttt{bibtex} can be found in~\cite{BibPat} 
and in~\cite{BibMar}. 
Also, Chapter 10 in~\cite{Gra} gives vital information on \texttt{bibtex}. 


\section{Indices}\label{sec:indices}

In case the \LaTeX{}-to-pdf converter writes index information, 
into its \gls{idx}-file, at least one index must be generated. 
Since the \gls{idx}-file contains nothing but index information, 
an index is created if and only if the \gls{idx}-file is created. 
% Well, this is not really the truth: it is needed only if ...
Essentially, 
the command \cmd{makeindex}{} tells \texttt{latex2pdf} 
to open the \gls{idx}-file for writing. 
Then for each occurrence of the \cmd{index}-command 
or similar (details see below) in the TEX file, 
an entry is written sequentially to the \gls{idx}-file as 
\cmd{indexentry}{} comprising the keyword given by the \cmd{index}-command 
and the page number where the \cmd{index}-command occured. 
For example \cmd{index\{ant-task\}}{} creates an entry 
%
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\indexentry{ant-task|hyperpage}{3}
\end{lstlisting}
%
in \texttt{xxx.idx}. 

Then the \texttt{makeindex}-command is applied to the \gls{idx}-file 
which sorts keywords and for each keyword collects the according page numbers, 
sorts it and and writes the result into a \gls{ind}-file. 
In the next run of \texttt{latex2pdf}, 
the \cmd{prindindex}-command includes the index as a separate section; 
typically at the end of the PDF file. 
The most basic package to provide this command 
is \pkg{makeidx} described in~\cite{MkidxShIdxP}. 
In addition, \pkg{makeidx} provides the command \cmd{see}{} 
which is for cross-reference within an index. 
The package \pkg{tocbibind} described in~\cite{TocBibIndP}, 
then writes the headline of the index into the table of contents.\index{table of contents}
The package \pkg{rerunfilecheck} described in~\cite{RerunFChkP}, 
ensures that \texttt{latex2pdf} is rerun if needed, 
provided loaded with option \texttt{aux}. 

The same document,~\cite{MkidxShIdxP} 
also describes the package \pkg{showidx} 
which prints index entries at the margin of the document. 
This is for debugging only. 
\medskip


The main restriction of the package \pkg{makeidx} is, 
that only a single index can be created. 
The reason is that, \texttt{latex2pdf} creates a single \gls{idx}-file 
and, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:idx2ind}, 
\texttt{makeindex} creates a single ind-file from that, 
representing a single index. 

To overcome this restriction, 
replace package \pkg{makeidx} and \texttt{makeindex} 
with package \pkg{splitidx} and \texttt{splitindex} 
both described in~\cite{SplitidxP}. 

The package \pkg{splitidx} is used 
in conjunction with the program \texttt{splitindex}. 
It must be possible to create a single index 
without using \pkg{splitidx} and \texttt{splitindex}. **** 

Package option \texttt{split} makes \texttt{latex2pdf} 
creating \gls{idx}-files \texttt{xxx-y.idx} directly. 
Here \texttt{y} represents the identifier of an individual index. 
These \gls{idx}-files can be transformed individually with \texttt{makeindex} 
into ind-files as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:idx2indMult}. 
Since \texttt{latex2pdf} can keep open only up to 16 output streams, 
not all of which can be used to create a file \texttt{xxx-y.idx}, 
this approach allows a limited number of indices 
and is thus not recommended and not supported. 
Another reason is, that this approach undermines 
the package \pkg{rerunfilecheck} described in~\cite{RerunFChkP}, 
and so it is not guaranteed that \texttt{latex2pdf} is rerun if needed. 
This explains why option \texttt{split} is not allowed. 
% **** check? 

Instead, without option \texttt{split}, 
\texttt{latex2pdf} creates a single \gls{idx}-file. 
The program \texttt{splitindex} splits it up into several \gls{idx}-files 
and applies \texttt{makeindex} to each of them separately 
as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:idx2indSplit}. 

For usage of further packages supporting multiple indices 
which are not intended to be used with this software, 
see Chapter~\ref{chap:gaps}. 

This software presupposes, that \texttt{makeindex} converts the \gls{idx}-file 
into an ind-file containing the index 
and creating also an ilg-file with logging output 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:idx2ind}. 
From the ilg-file this software may determine 
whether \texttt{makeindex} emitted an error or warnings.

\end{figure}

It is possible to configure the makeindex-command 
and to pass arbitrary options. 
CAUTION\@: For the usual \texttt{makeindex}-command, 
the options \texttt{-o} specifying an output file 
and \texttt{-t} (transcript) specifying the logging file are not allowed, 
because this breaks the expectation to find the sorted index 
in file \texttt{xxx.ind} 
and bypasses the detection of errors and warnings of this software, 
respectively. 
Also specifying a style file via option \texttt{-s} 
is not recommended because this is used to create a glossary 
and so breaks glossary creation 
as described in Section~\ref{sec:glossaries}. 

Information on the makeindex program can be found in~\cite{MkIdxMoe} 
and in~\cite{MkIdxLam}. 
Also, there is a site~\cite{MakeIdxOpts} 
describing all available options for \texttt{makeindex}. 

As indicated above, the program \texttt{splitindex} 
invokes \texttt{makeindex}. 
Its options are described in~\cite{SplitidxP}, Section~3.10. 
Since the long option names are not understood in all environments, 
only the short options are recommended. 

Since \texttt{splitindex} must satisfy the interface 
given by Figure~\ref{fig:idx2indSplit}, 
the option \texttt{--help} and its shortcut \texttt{-h} are not allowed. 
Likewise for option \texttt{--version} and its shortcut \texttt{-V}. 
The option \texttt{--makeindex <makeindex>}, resp.~\texttt{-m <makeindex>}, 
is used with the \texttt{makeindex} command used for single indices. 
Thus, this may not be given explicitly but is specified implicitly. 
Also, the option \texttt{--identify <regex>}, resp.~\texttt{-i <regex>} 
must be set implicitly because it must be the same expression 
as used to ***** 
Then splitindex.tlu is not allowed, 
because this has another expression. 

Only allowable seems \texttt{-V}, the shortcut for \texttt{--verbose}. 

Then comes the name of the index file to be processed 
without suffix. 

The program \texttt{splitindex} invokes \texttt{makeindex}. 
The option option \texttt{--} coming after the filename, 
indicates that all following options are passed to \texttt{makeindex} 



\section{Glossaries}\label{sec:glossaries}

CAUTION\@: The method described here, 
has at least two severe bugs: 
The number of reruns of the \LaTeX-to-pdf converter and also of \texttt{makeglossaries} 
is not guaranteed as a consequence of a bug in \pkg{rerunfilecheck} 
and the fact, that it does not fit current versions of \pkg{makeglossaries}. 
In addition, entries of the glossaries not mentioned directly in the document 
but must be included because they are used in the explanation of entries to be included 
are not treated properly. 

As a consequence, this document, or to be more precise its glossary, 
could not always be reproduced and so the author excluded the glossary until the problem is fixed. 

In addition, it is a conceptual weakness that a glossary data base 
shall be centralized and shall thus not be included in a \LaTeX{} document 
and not even be written in \LaTeX. 
All weaknesses, bugs and conceptual shortcomings are overcome 
by the package \pkg{glossaries-extra} in conjunction with the auxiliary program \texttt{bib2gls} 
which will replace \pkg{glossaries} and \texttt{makeglossaries}. 
For the time being, use glossaries with caution. 
\medskip


Creating glossaries 
requires the package \pkg{glossaries} described in~\cite{GloP}. 
Note that despite the headline of this section, 
and despite \pkg{glossaries} itself supports multiple glossaries, 
this software supports only a single glossary 
and also sorting and unifying is done 
either via \texttt{makeindex} as for indices or via \texttt{xindy}, 
whereas the option to do without external programs 
offered also by package \pkg{glossaries} 
is not supported by this software. 

For generalizations see Chapter~\ref{chap:gaps}. 

As for creating indices there is a \LaTeX-command \cmd{makeindex}, 
to create a glossary there is a \LaTeX-command \cmd{makeglossaries}{}, 
but the latter is not built-in as \cmd{makeindex} 
but provided by the package \pkg{glossaries}. 
If \texttt{xxx.tex} is the \LaTeX{} main file, 
\cmd{makeglossaries}{} opens the glo-file \texttt{xxx.glo} 
containing glossary entries for writing. 
As the built-in command \cmd{index}{} 
writes entries into the \gls{idx}-file defining the index, 
the command \cmd{gls}{} defined by the package \pkg{glossaries} 
writes an entry into the glo-file. 
Note that \texttt{xxx.glo} typically contains entries more than once 
and that the entries are not sorted. 

To perform sorting, formatting and typically also unification, 
the package \pkg{glossaries} allows three mechanisms. 
This software supports two of them: 
via the shell command \texttt{makeindex}, which is also used for indices, 
and via the shell command \texttt{xindy}. 
Using \texttt{makeindex} is the default but can also be activated through 
\cmd{usepackage[makeindex]\{glossaries\}}. 
Using \texttt{xindy} instead of \texttt{makeindex} is triggered through 
\cmd{usepackage[xindy]\{glossaries\}}. 
Accordingly, for option \texttt{makeindex} the aux-file receives lines 
%
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\providecommand\@istfilename[1]{}
\@istfilename{manualLMP.ist}
\end{lstlisting}
%
whereas for option \texttt{xindy}, there are lines 
%
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\providecommand\@istfilename[1]{}
\@istfilename{manualLMP.xdy}
...
\providecommand\@xdylanguage[2]{}
\@xdylanguage{main}{english}
\providecommand\@gls@codepage[2]{}
\@gls@codepage{main}{}
\end{lstlisting}



This software neither invokes \texttt{makeindex} nor \texttt{xindy} directly. 
Instead, it invokes the shell command \texttt{makeglossaries}
invoked without file ending  
which determines from the aux-file 
whether to invoke \texttt{makeindex} nor \texttt{xindy}. 
Accordingly, it writes the style definition 
by creating an ist-file \texttt{xxx.ist} or an xdy-file \texttt{xxx.xdy} 
if \texttt{makeindex} or \texttt{xindy} is specified as package option, 
respectively. 

Seemingly, \texttt{makeglossaries} relies on the aux-file 
to determine whether to invoke \texttt{makeindex} or \texttt{xindy} 
for sorting and unification. 
Then it invokes the according command and writes a LOG file 
with ending \texttt{glg}, 
redirecting the logging output of \texttt{makeindex} or \texttt{xindy} 
adding own output so that a glg-file may be written, 
even if e.g.~\texttt{makeindex} is invoked and does not. 
In any case, if the glg-file is written, 
\texttt{makeglossaries} writes text matching 
%
\begin{verbatim}
(^\*\*\* unable to execute: )
\end{verbatim}
%
in the glg-file if an error occurs, 
no matter whether \texttt{makeindex} or \texttt{xindy} is invoked. 
Possibly, there are cases where an error causes no glg-file to be written. 
If no error occurs, a glg-file is written 
and if warnings are emitted, 
they either come from \texttt{makeindex} or from \texttt{xindy}. 
Thus warnings may be detected with the patterns 
defined by \texttt{makeindex} and by \texttt{xindy}. 

The style \texttt{list} (which is the default) is set in the form 
%
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\usepackage[style=list]{glossaries}
\end{lstlisting}
%
where~\cite{GloP}, Section~15 lists predefined styles. 
So, the style determines the content of the style definition, 
whereas the options \texttt{makeindex} and \texttt{xindy} 
specify the form in which the style is encoded 
and thus the ending of the style file, 
which is either \texttt{ist} or \texttt{xdy}. 

Sorting the glo-file, as said above, 
currently is only supported using the command \texttt{makeglossaries}. 
The allowed options are essentially those 
making sense for \texttt{makeindex} and those making sense for \texttt{xindy}. 
If the shell command \texttt{makeglossaries} 
invokes \texttt{makeindex} of course only the according options 
are passed supplemented by additional options 
\texttt{-s}, \texttt{-t}, \texttt{-o}, to specify the
ist-file, the glg-file (the transcript-file) and the gls-file,
respectively, 
which is the result of sorting, the output file, 
and contains the entries of the glo-file 
just sorted, formatted and unified.
So for a tex main file \texttt{xxx.tex} the program 
\texttt{makeglossaries} invokes
%
\begin{verbatim}
makeindex  -s "xxx.ist" -t "xxx.glg" -o "xxx.gls" "xxx.glo"
\end{verbatim}
%
Accordingly, if the shell command \texttt{makeglossaries} 
invokes \texttt{xindy} of course only the according options 
are passed supplemented by additional options 
\texttt{-M}, \texttt{-t}, \texttt{-o}. 
This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:glo2gls}.

\section{Including code via \texttt{pythontex}}\label{sec:pythontex}

The package \pkg{pythontex}, described in~\cite{PythonTexP} 
originally allowed including Python code into a latex document. 
Later on, further languages were added, most notably octave or Matlab, 
and the user can easily extended it to further languages 
as sketched in~\cite{PythonTexP}. Section 7. 
Of course, to that end, the interpreter for the desired language must be installed.\index{pythontex}
The meaning of the term ``including'' used above 
ranges from mere listing to pure execution and comprises also inserting results of execution. 
A field of application is also creating figures. 

Note that like the package \pkg{splitindex}, also \pkg{pythonindex} 
comes with an according auxiliary program, 
in this case, besides \texttt{pythontex} also \texttt{depythontex}. 
Consequently,~\cite{PythonTexP} is not only on the package 
but also on the corresponding command line tools. 
Since~\cite{PythonTexP} is quite detailed, 
there is an introduction~\cite{PythonTexQ} and a gallery~\cite{PythonTexG}. 
For background on the intentions of package \pkg{pythontex}, consult~\cite{PythonTexRepr}. 
Information required to integrate pythontex into this software 
partially goes much beyond the official documentation and is collected in~\cite{PyTexInOut}. 
It could also be interesting for the user for debugging. 

Running the \LaTeX-to-pdf converter on a file \texttt{xxx.tex} 
with package \pkg{pythontex} loaded 
yields a file \texttt{xxx.pytxcode} 
and if the package is loaded with option \texttt{depythontex} 
also a file \texttt{xxx.depytx}.
If the file \texttt{xxx.pytxcode} is present, 
this software invokes the command line tool \texttt{pythontex} 
(same name as the according package) 
to \texttt{xxx.pytxcode} (without ending) 
which converts this into a variety of output files, 
which are, without further configuration, 
all in the folder \texttt{pythontex-files-xxx}
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:py2dir}, 
which is described in more detail in~\cite{PyTexInOut}, Section~3. 
Note that this software uses the wrapper \texttt{pythontexW}\index{pythontexW} 
of \texttt{pythontex} described in Section~\ref{subsec:pythontexW}, 
instead of \texttt{pythontex} itself. 
The figure reflects this. 

% TBD: later on, if \texttt{xxx.depytx} after \texttt{pythontex} also \texttt{pythontex} is invoked, 
% creating a tex file without python code. 
% TBD: clarify what if input files or include files are present. 

Running the \LaTeX-to-pdf converter again, 
includes all the output files \texttt{*.stdout} 
in the PDF file or whatever output file created. 

% Note that if depythontex is invoked, it is immaterial whether the subsequent run of LaTeX-to-pdf converter 
% is on the original tex file or on the tex file created by depythontex. 

An important remark is that \lualatex{} is the preferred converter, 
because files \texttt{*.stdout} can impose heavy memory usage 
and currently \lualatex{} is the only converter allocating memory dynamically. 

As one can see, \texttt{pythontex} cooperates with \lualatex{} in a way 
also \texttt{bibtex} or the other auxiliary programs do. 
Although \texttt{pythontex}, at time of this writing in version 0.18, 
is quite mature, it refrains from writing a log file and indicates errors and warnings 
just on standard output or error output. 
This is unlike all the other auxiliary programs in a line with \texttt{pythontex}. 
As a consequence, in particular warnings are difficult to detect 
and cannot be detected in a uniform way. 
Thus, the author wrote a little wrapper, called \texttt{pythontexW} 
and place it where it can be found, e.g.~in the folder of \texttt{pythontex}. 

Accordingly, \texttt{depythontex} behaves in a non-standard way: 
Firstly, by default, it does not output a result file but outputs on standard output. 
This can be changed using the option \texttt{--output} or \texttt{-o} for short. 
Also, \texttt{depythontex} changes into interactive mode 
if the output file is already present. 
To avoid this, the option \texttt{--overwrite} is required. 
Overwriting without asking is the standard behavior of all other auxiliary programs. 
As \texttt{pythontex} also \texttt{depythontex} does not write a log file 
but just prints its errors and warnings. 
Thus, the author wrote a little wrapper, 
called \texttt{depythontexW} and described in Section~\ref{subsec:pythontexW}, 
and place it where it can be found, e.g.~in the folder of \texttt{depythontex}\index{depythontexW}. 
% TBD: evaluate: maybe it is a better solution to enable this software itself to write the output to a log file. 
\medskip


The package \pkg{pythontex} and the according auxiliary programs are highly configurable, 
more than this software allows. 

In particular, in the \LaTeX{} document, 
the commands \cmd{setpythontexoutputdir} setting the output directory 
and \cmd{setpythontexworkingdir} setting the working directory shall not be used, 
because this software assumes the default, that the working directory is the directory 
containing the \LaTeX{} main file \texttt{xxx.tex}
and the output directory is in the working directory 
and its name is \texttt{pythontex-files-xxx}. 

Further, the package \pkg{pythontex} can be configured with package options when loading the package. 
Since this software is designed for reproducibility, 
most appropriate would be to specify \texttt{runall=true} meaning that even if no python code is modified 
the auxiliary program \texttt{pythontex} executes the python code in the document. 
Also, it is appropriate to specify \texttt{rerun=always}. 
Note that the defaults are \texttt{runall=false} and \texttt{rerun=errors}. 
This behavior makes sense to speed up creation of the document, 
but it differs from the behavior of all other auxiliary programs 
and causes the check for update of output files to fail. 
Moreover, reproducibility is not as easily shown. 

The package documentation~\cite{PythonTexP} suggests, 
that this makes a difference between \texttt{runall=true/false} 
and \texttt{rerun=always/errors} if external sources are modified, 
but as is proved in~\cite{PyTexInOut}, Section 2.1, 
the package translates package option \texttt{runall=true/false} into key value pair \texttt{rerun=always/errors} 
and this is the only information \texttt{pythontex} obtains from the package, 
so there is no difference. 

Also, the auxiliary program \texttt{pythontex} itself can be configured via command line arguments. 
For the package options \texttt{runall} and \texttt{rerun}, 
there are according command line options \texttt{-{}-runall} and \texttt{-{}-rerun} with the same scope. 
Whereas the package merges options \texttt{runall} and \texttt{rerun} silently, 
the auxiliary program \texttt{pythontex} emits an error, if both are combined. 
Essentially one can forget about \texttt{runall} and stick to \texttt{rerun}. 

Strange enough, according to~\cite{PythonTexP}, Section 4.1, package options overwrite command line options. 
This software shall invoke \texttt{pythontex} 
with the option \texttt{-{}-rerun=always} which is thus specified as the default. 
To force unconditional update, this is not sufficient. 
Instead, this software relies on an undocumented feature of auxiliary program \texttt{pythontex} 
which is likely not to change: 
If one of the expected output files is missing, it recreates all output files, independent of command line options and package options. 
Thus, this software deletes one output file if present, before executing \texttt{pythontex}. 

When this software invokes \texttt{pythontex} 
the exit codes may not be changed via \texttt{-{}-error-exit-code}, 
i.e.~if specified then with value \texttt{true}. 
Neither the options \texttt{-{}-interactive}, \texttt{-h}, \texttt{-{}-help} or \texttt{-{}-version} are allowed. 
Currently, this software does not check for options which are not allowed. 
Fortunately, the latter two command line options have no counterpart in the package configuration. 




If we place some code, e.g.~python code as inline code using \cmd{pyc}
%
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\footnotesize]
  \usepackage[depythontex]{pythontex}
  ...
  \pyc|print(rf'Python inside latex says: "Hello World; 1+1={1+1}"')|
\end{lstlisting}
%
the code is really evaluated and the string result is included at proper place 
as illustrated by the following text which is created by python: 
%
\begin{quote}
  \texttt{\pyc|print(rf'Python inside latex says: "Hello World; 1+1={1+1}"')|}. % chktex 26  chktex 18 chktex 36
\end{quote}
%
Note that the typewriter font is not created by python, 
it is explicitly set to highlight the string created by python, 
but it is python which evaluates the little computation 
and which prints the string. 

Since \texttt{pythontex} is written in python, 
including python code in the \LaTeX{} document 
uses the python interpreter already installed, as a prerequisite of \texttt{pythontex}. 
To use another language, the according interpreter must be installed in addition to python.

  This is reflected in the figure.

\section{Rerunning the index- and glossary processor}%
\label{sec:rerunMakeIndexGlossaries}

As described in Section~\ref{sec:tex2pdf}, 
running a \LaTeX-to-pdf converter as \texttt{latex2pdf} 
may detect the presence of a bibliography, an index and/or of a glossary 
and writes raw files to describe them. 
After that, an intermediate step is required, 
sorting, unifying and formatting the entries. 
This is always done by an external program. 

In the next step the \LaTeX{} processor must read in the unified entries again. 
Whereas a \LaTeX-run affects neither the bibliography nor python code, 
it may well invalidate the page numbers 
of the entries of the index or of the glossary. 
%Also within a glossary entry, further glossary entries may be included. 
Thus, the sorted index and glossary must be rebuilt 
before the next \LaTeX{} run makes them visible in the PDF file. 

To that end, we use the package \pkg{rerunfilecheck}. 
%
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\usepackage[index, glossary]{rerunfilecheck}
\end{lstlisting}
%
must be put before 
%
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\usepackage{makeidx}
\makeindex
\usepackage[toc, xindy]{glossaries}
%, xindy or even [xindy={language=english,codepage=utf8}]
% mainly for index and glossaries 
\makeglossaries
\end{lstlisting}
%
in particular before \cmd{makeindex}{} and \cmd{makeglossaries}. 

Note that the package \pkg{hyperref} already loads \pkg{rerunfilecheck} 
but with the wrong options. 
Thus, the above declaration must come before 
%
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\usepackage[...]{hyperref}
\end{lstlisting}
%
to avoid error 
%
\begin{verbatim}
Option clash for package rerunfilecheck
\end{verbatim}

Package \pkg{rerunfilecheck} detects almost safely 
changes of the raw index file writing an according message 
into the LOG file. 
That way, it can be determined whether it is necessary 
to rerun \texttt{makeindex} and \texttt{makeglossaries}. 
After that, of course \LaTeX{} must be rerun at least once. 
Note that Section~\ref{sec:rerunLatex} describes 
when to rerun \LaTeX{} without prior running *****

\section{Rerunning the \LaTeX{} processor}\label{sec:rerunLatex}

FIXME\@: a word on change in toc, lof, lot and lol. 

As indicated in the previous sections, 
\texttt{latex2pdf} must be rerun, 
if \texttt{bibtex} or \texttt{makeindex} \texttt{splitindex} 
or \texttt{makeglossaries} 
had been run 
to read in the bibliography created by \texttt{bibtex} 
or the index created by \texttt{makeindex} 
or the glossary created by \texttt{makeglossaries}. 
Likewise, if a toc-file, a lof-file, a lot-file or a lol-file
had been created in the first \texttt{latex2pdf} run, 
another run is needed to read in these files 
to create a table of contents, a list of figures or a list of tables, 
respectively. 
Note that for all these cases, 
the LOG file does not allow to detect that \texttt{latex2pdf} has to be rerun, 
by matching a fixed pattern. 

After the second run of \texttt{latex2pdf}, 
the table of contents,
the list of figures, the list of tables and the list of listings 
are included and a section with the bibliography, 
the index and the glossary are inserted. 
It takes a third run of \texttt{latex2pdf} 
to include the bibliography the index and the glossary 
into the table of contents. 
Also, it takes that third run to replace the citations 
with the proper labels given in the bibliography. 

Inserting the table of contents,
the list of figures, the list of tables and the list of listings 
may shift the subsequent text 
which may require another run of \texttt{latex2pdf} 
to get the page numbers right. 
As described in Section~\ref{sec:rerunMakeIndexGlossaries} 
intermediate runs of \texttt{makeindex} and \texttt{makeglossaries} 
may be required 
and these also require another run of \texttt{latex2pdf} 
also to get the page numbers right. 
The package \pkg{rerunfilecheck} allows to detect this need to rerun 
by pattern matching on the LOG file almost for sure: 
Still there is some chance 
that the lengths and the md5-sum of all relevant files 
remain the same, although there is a relevant change. 
In this case, this software fails to update 
triggering another \texttt{latex2pdf} run. 


Note that there are several packages which require additional runs, 
such as the package \pkg{longtable}, 
which may vary dimensions of tables. 
This software presupposes, that all these reruns 
may be detected by matching a fixed pattern in the LOG file. 
Since packages are frequently changed and new packages are written, 
also the pattern cannot be fixed. 
Thus, it is configurable. 
 
Note that, if a package requires running other programs 
between two runs of \texttt{latex2pdf}, 
this would require a change in this software. 

\section{Checking reproducibility }\label{sec:chkReprod}

There are use cases, where it is extremely important 
that the according artifacts are really reproducible. 
One is when we have to deliver the sources 
and the receiver has to reconstruct the artifacts. 
Another obvious use case is integration test for this software 
by ensuring that each artifact created 
is equivalent with a confirmed version, 
although this software changed. 
Details are given in Section~\ref{chap:tests}. 


Currently, reproducibility checks are supported for PDF files only. 
% TBD: change that 
The problem with PDF files is, that besides visible contents 
they contain also meta-data (see~\cite{pdf17}, Section 14.3), 
which depends on the run of the conversion. 
For example the timestamp of conversion goes into and so do many more aspects. 

There are two strategies to deal with the problem: 
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
  Make the build process reproducible. 
  The advantage of this approach is that diffing is quite simple, 
  fast and reproducible: it is byte by byte. 
  This is easily done with a fixed installation 
  but tends to break with update of tools. 
  % TBD: allow own version check. 
  Also, at time of this writing, 
  the different latex engines cannot be treated uniformly. 
  % TBD: a feature request to hyperref is already posted. 
  % let us keep an eye on that. 
  \item 
  Use diff tools implementing a weaker notion of equivalence, 
  in a sense visibility equivalence of some degree. 
  One approach is the script \texttt{vmdiff} 
  described in Section~\ref{subsec:pythontexW}. 
\end{itemize}%

We support both approaches, but the first one is the preferred one 
in the sense understood in Chapter~\ref{chap:tests}. 
As described in much detail in~\cite{LatexGen}, Section 4, 
essentially, there are two ways to make the build process reproducible. 

The simpler and again the preferred one, 
is by setting the system time to a fixed value. 
If the document contains a date created by \cmd{today}, 
then this is according to the fixed value and thus wrong value. 
We use reproducibility in that sense only for tests; thus this is acceptable. 
If the PDF files are intended to be published, the date must be correct. 
The idea is, to recompile with the correct date for publishing. 
Then for tests a pom checking equality is used, 
and for publishing another pom without this check. 
The system time is manipulated only when performing equality tests. 

Of course, other techniques are also conceivable, 
but this is the one implemented at time of this writing. 
One alternative would be to refrain from having a current date, 
but some date changing not so frequently. 
Still meta-data includes the trailer identifier 
which is based on system time set. 
As described in Section~\ref{subsec:headerSuppressMetaPDF}, 
we could include a header suppressing a sufficient amount of meta-data, 
at least the trailer identifier. 
Then the resulting PDF files are reproducible, 
provided \lualatex{} or \pdflatex{} is used, but not for \xelatex. 
This lack of uniformity alone makes this approach inferior, 
so we do not use for creating this manual. 

What we do use is the header providing privacy, 
to make it part of the preferred usage. 

% Thus, a reproducibility check is advisable as described below. 
% It is just by comparing the newly created PDF with an older version 
% and the date shall be the modification date of this older version. 
% The details are not yet implemented. 
% %TBD do that 
% Then the date shall be 

% The first one imposes requirements on the TEX source file. 
% It excludes that one displays a creation date changing each run. 
% For this manual, we replaced the creation date by a ``version date''. 
% A date can be only date of check in of a version control system or that like. 
% As an alternative, one could also refrain from using dates altogether. 
% In the \cmd{date} command 
% one could display also other pieces of information identifying the document. 

But the visible date is not all we have to care about. 
Section~\ref{subsec:headerSuppressMetaPDF} describes a header which eliminates a lot of metadata 
and to replace with adequate one. 
There is metadata which can be eliminated in a uniform way for all latex engines 
using the package \texttt{hyperref} which the author generally advises. 
Using \texttt{hyperref} with \cmd{hypersetup} 
one can set metadata such as author, title, subject and keyword 
as described in~\cite{HyperTextP}, Section 5.8. 
Here we eliminate creation date and modification date for sake of reproducibility, 
and we also eliminate the producer for security reason. 

Besides the date and time, there is another piece of metadata, the \texttt{trailerid}, 
which is to ensure that each run of a \LaTeX{} to PDF compiler runs 
different PDF files are produced. 
This identifier can only be set in a way specific for the \LaTeX{} compiler. 
Caution: \xelatex{} causes \cmd{ifpdf} to enter always the \texttt{else} branch. 
Note that for \xelatex{} further techniques are required to reach reproducibility. 
% TBD: make this more specific. 
Except for \xelatex, the header described in Section~\ref{subsec:headerSuppressMetaPDF} 
is a means to eliminate all information 
making the document reproducible also without \pkg{hyperref}, 
but this applies only to newer versions. 
Besides code the listing provides a lot of documentation. 
In that for \pdflatex{} also the package \pkg{pdfprivacy} described in~\cite{PdfPriv} is mentioned 
as a convenient alternative. 

If a user renounces independence of the engine and sticks to \pdflatex{} only, 
the package \texttt{hyperref} 
could be replaced by specific commands. 
Also, using the package \texttt{iftex} one can detect the used engine 
via the macros \cmd{ifLuaTeX}, \cmd{ifXeTeX} 
and \cmd{ifPDFTeX} as illustrated in \texttt{headerSuppressMetaPDF.tex} 
described in Section~\ref{subsec:headerSuppressMetaPDF}
and adapt the code to the engine. 

% TBD: clarify: does hyperref replace the engine specific settings? 
% I think no, because of the trailerid, it does not, so iftex is always needed. 
% For pdftex I seem to do twice and once is sufficient. 
% I have the impression some things i do not for reproducibility 
% but I do for security. 
% All in all, we need additional research to write this section in a competent way. 






Now that we have described how to ensure reproducible PDF artifacts, 
just by designing the TEX source appropriately, 
we have to explain how to check that a newly created artifact 
coincides with a blueprint provided a priori. 
First, note that currently such a check is performed 
only if the result is in PDF format. 
Even then the check is performed only if configured so. 
Then the actual artifacts are compared to predefined artifacts 
using the configured diff-tool. 
If the actual artifacts do not coincide with predefined ones 
according to the chosen diff tool, 
a build exception is thrown as specified in Table~\ref{tab:TLP}. 
The configurations related with diff check are collected in Section~\ref{sec:paramRepro}. 


\section{Alternative build process with \texttt{latexmk}}\label{sec:latexmk}
\index{latexmk}

This section is on running the build process of \LaTeX{} main files 
with \texttt{latexmk} or equivalent. 
Although the functionality is readily explained, 
the intention is not so obvious: 
In Section~\ref{subsec:develLatexmk} 
describes the role of \texttt{latexmk} as a build tool 
in the course of document development, 
whereas this \LaTeX{} builder is for final, quality checked build. 
So the two tools seem to be complementary. 
Section~\ref{subsec:latChkRc} describes that this \LaTeX{} builder 
can write its own configuration as 
a config file \texttt{.latexmkrc} for \texttt{latexmk} 
so that builds with \texttt{latexmk} are in line 
with final builds by this \LaTeX{} builder itself. 

So running \texttt{latexmk} from within this \LaTeX{} builder 
seems superfluous at first sight. 
A closer look onto \texttt{.latexmkrc} unveils that this is just a Perl script 
which is very flexible realizing new or special functionality, 
whereas this \LaTeX{} builder is tied to a quite rigid configuration in the pom. 
So, for example if for building a document tools are needed 
which are not supported by this \LaTeX{} builder, 
their invocation can be implemented directly in \texttt{.latexmkrc}. 
Since this \LaTeX{} builder writes a single \texttt{.latexmkrc} 
in the root directory \texttt{texSrcDirectory}, 
which must be made available in each subfolder by adding a link, 
the config \texttt{.latexmkrc} by his \LaTeX{} builder 
may be replaced by a hand-crafted config file for each folder separately. 

Having explained this, the question arises 
why this \LaTeX{} builder does not in general rely on \texttt{latexmk} 
and invokes \LaTeX{} compilers and other converters directly. 
One reason is that \LaTeX{} builder does not only invoke converters, 
it also checks return values and, depending on the converter, 
log files emitting errors and warnings if appropriate. 
So, delegating to \texttt{latexmk} 
the user can no longer check that the build process passed without warning or error. 
A second aspect is, that the build algorithms differ: 
\texttt{latexmk} runs the \LaTeX{} main file then detecting which files are missing 
and then tries to build these based on rules. 
The basic idea behind is ``backward discovery'' of dependencies, 
whereas this \LaTeX{} builder first builds the graphic files globally 
(\texttt{latexmk} detects last) 
before for each \LaTeX{} main file is compiled. 
So this \LaTeX{} builder combines ``forward discovery'' and backwards discovery. 
Pure  backward discovery is more elegant 
but as the \LaTeX{} compiler stops at each graphic file not present 
before creating it and rerunning the \LaTeX{} main file, 
it may result in excessive reruns if there are many created graphics in the document. 

So there are strong reasons to avoid \texttt{latexmk}, 
but there are also reasons to allow in special cases. 
The parameter \texttt{\$latexmkUsage} described in Table~\ref{tab:paramGen} 
on page \pageref{tab:paramGen} allows gradually use of \texttt{latexmk}, 
not at all, fully or as backend creating graphic files a priori. 
As a rule, \texttt{latexmk} shall be used as much as required and as little as possible. 

This shows also that it is a good thing 
to be able to activate \texttt{latexmk} in individual \LaTeX{} main files. 
In the next version, this is realized with magic comments. 
XXXXXX Reference to according section required. XXXXXXXX 
Whereas \texttt{\$latexmkUsage} allows three levels of usage, 
the magic comment can choose to use \texttt{latexmk} or not. 

The graphic files are preprocessed except if \texttt{\$latexmkUsage} is set to \texttt{Fully}. 
The magic comment results in a warning 
if it does not change whether \texttt{latexmk} 
is invoked or not compared to when it is absent. 


% this is only for goal pdf 
% and maybe even only if pdfViaDvi is not set: LatexProcessor.processLatex2pdf
% changes for latexmk must be done in LatexProcessor.processLatex2dev
% bypassing processLatex2devCore... not clear whether also bypassing warnings. 
% maybe better not doing so: at least part of warnings. 
% on the other hand: misleading. 
% maybe warning that warnings are bypassed. 
% This could be done globally if \texttt{\$latexmkUsage} is not NotAtAll. 
% Also specifically if triggered by a magic comment. 

% currently, preprocessing of graphic files is done in any case, 
% although specified differently. 

% make a note that still the return codes of latexmk are recorded resulting in EEX01 
% and also the presence of a pdf is monitored triggering EEC03 if not updated. 
% also the manual shows how to convert warnings into errors. 

% make a note: special for latexmk: may not touch pdf file although all ok: 
% return code is still 0 

% latexmk is never used for cleanup with latexmk -c or latexmk -C 

% on magic comments: 
% - target: currently, latexmk is applied only to pdf creation. 
%           the target is determined on a higher level, so it is taken into account 
% - program: taken into account. 
% - latexmk: this magic comment shall be added, 
%            because in many cases latexmk is only wanted for individual latex main files. 
%            It is only to switch latexmk usage on
%            There is some interference with latexmkUsage: 
%            - no effect for Fully and AsBackend 
%            - For NotAtAll, graphics are created already. 



% preferred usage: 
% latexmkUsage=NotAtAll, but activation by magic comment shall be preferred usage. 
% this brings problems finding out whether really latexmk has been used. 
% an idea would be to include the fdb_latexmk file as this is specific for latexmk 
% But this has to be done in a way, that compilation still works if not present. 
% Only the diff to the original fails then. 
% In fact, even two latex main files are required: 
% - one for which latexmk is activated although latexmkUsage is set to the default NotAtAll
% - another one for which latexmk is not requested by magic comment. 
% This can be any document which is already present. 

% Maybe check that latexmk respects also the compiler given by magic comment. 
% Decision: no: is checked for one document once and this is suficient although later it is compiled generically. 
% This is decided because wrong compiler is detected quickly. 

% latexmk can be invoked as 
% SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=0 FORCE_SOURCE_DATE=1 latexmk xxx.tex 
% as well. 
% That way all converters are invoked with the same environment variables. 
% The deceicive ones are xxxlatex and dvipdf 
% It may be a good idea to provide ntlatexmk analogous to ntlatex as an injection. 
% Adapt documentation accordinly. 




% baglock: chkDiff as a magic comment. 
% this may be better in many cases than a global setting chkDiff (although this has applications also)

% TBD: adapt manual. 




\section{Creating hypertext}\label{sec:tex2html}

To create HTML and XHTML from TEX files (more precise from \LaTeX{} files), 
a \texttt{tex4htCommand}-command is used 
Together with its parameters, 
it is described in Section!\ref{sec:settingsLatex2Html}. 
This may be \texttt{htlatex}, the default based on \texttt{latex} 
and \texttt{htxelatex} based on \xelatex. 

Figure~\ref{fig:tex2xml} shows the steps \texttt{htlatex} performs: 
From the input \LaTeX{} file \texttt{xxx.tex} 
another \LaTeX{} file \texttt{yyy.tex} is created 
which arises from \texttt{xxx.tex} by adding 
%FIXME\@: maybe instead: \RequirePackage which may be placed before documentclass
\begin{lstlisting}[language=TeX]
\usepackage[...]{tex4ht}. 
\end{lstlisting}
%
Then \texttt{htlatex} runs \texttt{latex} on \texttt{yyy.tex} 
which results in \texttt{yyy.dvi}. 
Note that this is in contrast to \lualatex{} 
which would create some \texttt{yyy.pdf} unless otherwise specified. 

Then comes the converter \pkg{tex4ht} into the game 
which creates several html-files among those also \texttt{xxx.html}. 
The other files, \texttt{yyy.idv} and \texttt{yyy.lg}, 
are further processed by \texttt{t4ht} 
creating the stylesheet \texttt{xxx.css} and graphic files. 
\medskip


Let us make this more precise. 
The output of latex is a standard \gls{dvi}-file 
interleaved with special instructions 
for the post-processor \pkg{tex4ht} to use. 
Note that \pkg{tex4ht} is the name both of the post-processor 
and of the \LaTeX-package. 
The special instructions come from implicit and explicit requests 
made in the source file through commands for TeX4ht. 

The utility \pkg{tex4ht} translates the dvi-code into standard text, 
while obeying the requests it gets from the special instructions. 
The special instructions may request the creation of files, 
insertion of html code, filtering of pictures, and so forth. 
In the extreme case that the source code contains no commands of TeX4ht, 
\pkg{tex4ht} gets pure dvi-code and it outputs (almost) plain text 
with no hypertext elements in it.

The special (\cmd{special}) 
instructions seeded in the dvi-code 
are not understood by dvi processors other than those of TeX4ht.

\texttt{t4ht}
This is an interpreter 
for executing the requests made in the \texttt{xxx.lg} script.

\texttt{xxx.idv}
This is a dvi-file extracted from \texttt{xxx.dvi}, 
and it contains the pictures needed in the html files.

\texttt{xxx.lg}
This is a log file listing the pictures of \texttt{xxx.idv}, 
the \gls{png} files that should be created, CSS information, 
and user directives introduced 
through the ``\cmd{Needs\{\ldots\}}'' command.

\section{Creating odt-files}\label{sec:tex2odt}

\section{Creating MS word files}\label{sec:tex2doc}

The best way to convert \LaTeX{} files into MS word files is via ODT files. 
Conversion from \LaTeX{} to odt 
is already described in Section~\ref{sec:tex2odt}. 
The last step can be done by \texttt{odt2doc} which can create both 
doc-format and docx-format and many others 
which is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:tex2doc}. 


\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\IfPackageLoadedTF{tex4ht}{%
should be a picture 
}{
\import{}{F5_10tex2doc.ptx}
}
\caption{\label{fig:tex2doc}Conversion of a TEX file into a docx-file}
\end{figure}



\section{Creating plain text files}\label{sec:tex2txt}

Why should one create plain text from \LaTeX{} files? 
Maybe this is the minimal format the receiver can work with. 
Another common application is word-count, 
in particular if writing a paper for a journal. 

Plain text files can be created from \LaTeX{} files 
just by stripping off the tex-commands. 
The disadvantage is, 
that references, bibliography, index, glossary, 
table of contents, list of figures, list of tables, \dots 
and symbols get lost. 
Thus, the first step we take is complete creation of a PDF file 
except display of warnings like bad boxes 
as described in Section~\ref{sec:tex2pdf}. 
This creates an appropriate pdf-file, 
with correct numbering and links, 
possibly with overfull boxes and that like. 
As a final step, we convert the pdf-file into a text file 
using, as a default \texttt{pdftotext} with ending \texttt{txt}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:tex2txt} illustrates the translation process. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\IfPackageLoadedTF{tex4ht}{%
should be a picture 
}{
\import{}{F5_11tex2txt.ptx}
}
\caption{\label{fig:tex2txt}Conversion of a TEX file into a txt-file}
\end{figure}

Note that \texttt{pdftotext} produces a text file with page numbers 
and signifies the end of a page 
(to see how, just have a look at the end of the file), 
so that one can identify page numbers as such. 
Thus references, index, glossary, table of contents and that like 
referring to page numbers carry valuable information. 
Also symbols available in utf8 encoding are preserved. 
In contrast, heavily stacked formulae become unreadable, 
because \texttt{pdftotext} displays them line by line 
and drops fraction bars completely. 
Also, formulae with complex subformulae in a root operator  
become unreadable because the root operator becomes just a root symbol. 
Likewise for integrals and that like. 

Aspects of figures kept are the captions of course but also the \LaTeX-texts. 
This is displayed line-wise. 
What gets lost is the postscript/pdf-parts, i.e.~the plain graphics.
