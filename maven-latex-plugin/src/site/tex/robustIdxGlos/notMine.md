# Caution

This document is not written by myself. 
It does not only describe a robust index, 
it realizes what it describes. 
This is why we don't have it as a PDF file, but as a TEX file. 

As a consequence, we cannot treat it in a uniform way as we do for other documents here. 
In particular, we cannot use the default header. 
In fact, this is a reason for not adopting the ideas presented in this paper.
