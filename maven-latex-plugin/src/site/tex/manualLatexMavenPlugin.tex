\section{Introduction}

This piece of software implements both an ant task and a maven plugin 
generating documentation of various formats from LaTeX files 
in an uniform way. 
In particular, the settings which may be passed to the task 
and those allowed for the plugin are in a one-to-one relation. 
They are both described in Section \ref{sec:settings}. 

Both, the ant task and the maven plugin rely on the same code base 
which form the package {\tt org.m2latex.core}. 
The code specific for the ant task is in {\tt org.m2latex.antTask} 
and that specific for the maven plugin is in {\tt org.m2latex.mojo}. 

It is very usual to endow LaTeX-files with figures. 
We support figures created in the xfig-format 
by

\section{Installation}

The ant task is tested with 
{\tt Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.4 compiled on September 11 2015}
and the maven plugin with {\tt Apache Maven 3.2.1
(ea8b2b07643dbb1b84b6d16e1f08391b666bc1e9; 2014-02-14T18:37:52+01:00}). 
The java version is {\tt 1.8.0\_101, vendor: Oracle Corporation}. 

The task just passes parameters in the build file to the core 
and accordingly the maven plugin passes parameters in the pom 
to the core. 
The core just invokes various programs to do the actual work. 

To process the fig-files, by default {\tt fig2dev} is used. 
To create pdf-files from latex files we use {\tt pdflatex} 
or some other kind of latex creating pdf-files. 
LaTeX uses several auxiliary programs. 
Above all {\tt bibtex} to create the bibliography 
and {\tt makeindex} for the index. 

To create html-files, or to be more precise any kind of sgml and xml, 
from pdf-files, {\tt htlatex} is used. 
This includes also creating open office documents like odt-files. 
Thus open office documents are created in two steps, 
the first is to create pdf-files with the according tools, 
the second one is done by {\tt htlatex}. 

To create rtf-files, currently {\tt latex2rtf} is used. 
Note that this does not require {\tt pdflatex}. 
As a drawback, not all latex-packages are supported. 

MS word documents are created from open office documents via {\tt odt2doc} 
and thus require three steps. 

Finally, there is a way, to create plain text files from the pdf-files 
via {\tt pdftotext}. 
This makes sense because that text is well formatted 
and may contain unicode symbols like $\pi$. 

So to run this software, the abovementioned programs must be installed. 

TODO: how to install the maven-plugin and how the ant-task.
