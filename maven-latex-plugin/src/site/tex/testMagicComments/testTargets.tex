\begin{document}
Tests magic comment: exclude target \texttt{pdf} individually specifying \texttt{chk} and \texttt{dvi}. 
If this is not excluded, an invisible \texttt{\textbackslash{}GenericError} 
in an \texttt{\textbackslash{}ifpdf} construction throws an error leading to an error return code 
of the late processor. 
\ifpdf%
  \GenericError{...}{Found this document to be converted into a PDF, although this is excluded}{}{} % chktex 11
\else
\fi
If this does not work, a diff is initiated, but there is no comparison file, 
which would result in an error.
