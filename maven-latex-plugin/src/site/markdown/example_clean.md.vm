# Cleaning the texSrcDirectory with goal `clr`

In general, 
this software after a run deletes all files not present before that run. 
That way an explicit goal `clean` is superfluous. 

This changes if `cleanUp`, which is `true` by default, 
is set to `false` as shown in the next snippet of a pom. 

```[xml]
<project>
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
                <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
                <version>${project.version}</version>
                <inherited>false</inherited>
                <configuration>
                  <settings>
                    <targets>pdf,html</targets>
                    <cleanUp>false</cleanUp>
                  </settings>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```

With that configuration, intermediate auxiliary files, 
as e.g. log files are not deleted. 
This may make sense for debugging, 
e.g. searching for the reason of an error 
or when eliminating bad boxes. 

Auxiliary files which are created by other software but this one 
is also not deleted, independent of the value of `cleanUp`. 
But in the course of debugging it is sometimes a good idea 
to use more low level tools compared to this one. 

In these cases, for cleanup the goal `clr` is used. 
It is then necessary to ensure 
that the runs are independent and thus reproducible. 
The goal `clr` is tied to lifecycle phase `clean` by default. 
<!-- must be explained why this works also for site lifecycle -->

CAUTION: `clr` cannot be used as a target.
