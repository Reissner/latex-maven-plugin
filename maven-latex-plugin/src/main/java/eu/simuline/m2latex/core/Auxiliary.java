/**
 * Very bad name: 
 * Represents some aspect of postprocessing 
 * performed in {@link LatexProcessor#processLatex2devCore(LatexMainDesc, LatexDev)}. 
 * No it is auxiliary processing, 
 * because it is alternating auxiliary tools and latex compiler. 
 * <p>
 * Auxiliary processing consists of two parts: 
 * <ul>
 * <li>the run of a latex compiler, typically via a package loaded, 
 * writes (into) a file. 
 * This may be a specific file or a file common for more auxiliary processings. 
 * At time of this writing this is the AUX file. 
 * In that case, the latex run writes lines into the file 
 * which are specific for the auxiliary processing. 
 * <li>the subsequent run of an auxiliary program, 
 * triggered if that specific file is present, 
 * or if the specific lines in a common file are present. 
 * The auxiliary program reads the lines of that file 
 * and writes some file, typically another one, 
 * which is read by the next run of the latex compiler. 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * As described above, the initial run of the latex compiler 
 * writes (lines into) a file, 
 * the presence of which triggers invocation of the corresponding auxiliary program 
 * which writes some file which is read by the next run of the latex compiler. 
 * If the compiler writes a different file, 
 * of course the auxiliary program must be rerun and so on. 
 * There are really cases where this does not terminate 
 * so to ensure termination a maximal number of runs of the latex compiler is specified. 
 * <p>
 * Creating a bibliography with <code>bibtex</code> or equivalent, 
 * is one of the auxiliary processings {@link #BibTex}. 
 * It is a bit special in that the latex compiler does not need a special package 
 * to write the bibliographical information into the AUX file. 
 * The auxiliary program <code>bibtex</code> or that like extracts and sorts the entries 
 * into a BBL file which is read back by the latex compiler 
 * to create the bibliography. 
 * CAUTION: the lines of the AUX file read by <code>bibtex</code> 
 * may be altered by subsequent calls of a latex compiler or of an auxiliary program 
 * as shown by https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/724138/is-backreference-possible-with-bibtex-maybe-in-conjunction-with-biblatex. 
 * <p>
 * At time of this writing, bibliography with package <code>biblatex</code> 
 * in conjunction with auxiliary program <code>biber</code> is not yet supported. 
 * <p>
 * Writing an index is only supported via package <code>idxindex</code> 
 * and auxiliary program <code>makeindex</code>. 
 * This includes <code>splitindex</code> for multiple indices 
 * invoking <code>makeindex</code> internally. 
 * This is {@link #Idx}. 
 * Clearly a subsequent run of the latex compiler changes the index 
 * if the index entry moves to another page number. 
 * <p>
 * At time of this writing, indices with package <code>???</code> 
 * in conjunction with auxiliary program <code>xindy</code> is not yet supported. 
 *
